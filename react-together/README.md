## Day 4
### Finished scaffolding a rough draft of YouTube screen
1. Complete scaffolding YouTube Component

## Day 6
### Intro to WebSockets
1. Add Video Sync through WebSockets
    - First user to click `Watch Together` => Button turns Green and text changes to `Host`
        - Video is being sync'd from them
        - Long press switches the control to the other user
    - Second user to click `Watch Together` => Button turns Blue and text changes to `Guest`
        - Video is being controlled by `Host`
        - Regular press does nothing
        - (Optional) Long press sends and alert saying: `Switch video please` to Host
